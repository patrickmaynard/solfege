# solfege
This repository contains code and data related to the internet solfege database project.

The project aims to make several of the most popular classical themes (plus a few I just like) searchable via popular search engines. That way, if you have a classical theme stuck in your head, you may be able to look up what it is you've been obsessively whistling for three days. 

If you've seen The Sound of Music, you know a little bit of solfege. It's the "do re mi" representation of any given set of notes.

For example, the theme to Beethoven's 5th symphony goes "sol sol sol me ... fa fa fa re."
